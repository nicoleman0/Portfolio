# Portfolio - Nicholas Coleman
### Welcome to my portfolio page.

This is where I upload all of the various technical projects, and assignments I have been working on. <br>
<br>
Both my projects and assignments are uploaded to showcase my knowledge of various security principles, cyberattacks, and security controls.<br>
<br>
The written assignments are from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. <br>
The coding projects are my own.<br>
