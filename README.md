# Portfolio - Nicholas Coleman
### Welcome to my portfolio page.

This is where I upload all of the various technical projects I have been working on. <br>
<br>
My goal is to break into the cybersecurity industry *within the year 2025!*<br>
<br>
The written assignments are related to the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. <br>
The coding projects however, are of my own volition.<br>
