# Portfolio - Nicholas Coleman
### Welcome to my portfolio page.

This is where I upload all of the various technical projects I have been working on. <br>
<br>
My goal is to break into the cybersecurity industry *within the year 2025!*<br>
<br>
Most of my projects are related to either the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, or TryHackMe. <br>
Some of the projects are also just my own ideas.<br>
